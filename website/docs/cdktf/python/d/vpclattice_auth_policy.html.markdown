# Data Source: aws_vpclattice_auth_policy

Terraform data source for managing an AWS VPC Lattice Auth Policy.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.data_aws_vpclattice_auth_policy import DataAwsVpclatticeAuthPolicy
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataAwsVpclatticeAuthPolicy(self, "test",
            resource_identifier=Token.as_string(aws_vpclattice_auth_policy_test.resource_identifier)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `resource_identifier` - (Required) The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service network or service for which the policy is created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `policy` - The auth policy. The policy string in JSON must not contain newlines or blank lines.
* `state` - The state of the auth policy. The auth policy is only active when the auth type is set to AWS_IAM. If you provide a policy, then authentication and authorization decisions are made based on this policy and the client's IAM policy. If the Auth type is NONE, then, any auth policy you provide will remain inactive.

# Resource: aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list_entry

Provides a managed prefix list entry resource.

~> **NOTE on Managed Prefix Lists and Managed Prefix List Entries:** Terraform
currently provides both a standalone Managed Prefix List Entry resource (a single entry),
and a [Managed Prefix List resource](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) with entries defined
in-line. At this time you cannot use a Managed Prefix List with in-line rules in
conjunction with any Managed Prefix List Entry resources. Doing so will cause a conflict
of entries and will overwrite entries.

~> **NOTE on Managed Prefix Lists with many entries:**  To improved execution times on larger
updates, if you plan to create a prefix list with more than 100 entries, it is **recommended**
that you use the inline `entry` block as part of the [Managed Prefix List resource](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html)
resource instead.

## Example Usage

Basic usage

```python
# Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.ec2_managed_prefix_list import Ec2ManagedPrefixList
from imports.aws.ec2_managed_prefix_list_entry import Ec2ManagedPrefixListEntryA
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        example = Ec2ManagedPrefixList(self, "example",
            address_family="IPv4",
            max_entries=5,
            name="All VPC CIDR-s",
            tags={
                "Env": "live"
            }
        )
        Ec2ManagedPrefixListEntryA(self, "entry_1",
            cidr=Token.as_string(aws_vpc_example.cidr_block),
            description="Primary",
            prefix_list_id=example.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cidr` - (Required) CIDR block of this entry.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of this entry. Due to API limitations, updating only the description of an entry requires recreating the entry.
* `prefix_list_id` - (Required) CIDR block of this entry.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the managed prefix list entry.

## Import

Prefix List Entries can be imported using the `prefix_list_id` and `cidr` separated by a `,`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list_entry.default pl-0570a1d2d725c16be,10.0.3.0/24
```

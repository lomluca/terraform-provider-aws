# Resource: aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list_entry

Provides a managed prefix list entry resource.

~> **NOTE on Managed Prefix Lists and Managed Prefix List Entries:** Terraform
currently provides both a standalone Managed Prefix List Entry resource (a single entry),
and a [Managed Prefix List resource](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) with entries defined
in-line. At this time you cannot use a Managed Prefix List with in-line rules in
conjunction with any Managed Prefix List Entry resources. Doing so will cause a conflict
of entries and will overwrite entries.

~> **NOTE on Managed Prefix Lists with many entries:**  To improved execution times on larger
updates, if you plan to create a prefix list with more than 100 entries, it is **recommended**
that you use the inline `entry` block as part of the [Managed Prefix List resource](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html)
resource instead.

## Example Usage

Basic usage

```typescript
// Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Ec2ManagedPrefixList } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ec2-managed-prefix-list";
import { Ec2ManagedPrefixListEntryA } from "./.gen/providers/aws/ec2-managed-prefix-list-entry";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const example = new Ec2ManagedPrefixList(this, "example", {
      addressFamily: "IPv4",
      maxEntries: 5,
      name: "All VPC CIDR-s",
      tags: {
        Env: "live",
      },
    });
    new Ec2ManagedPrefixListEntryA(this, "entry_1", {
      cidr: Token.asString(awsVpcExample.cidrBlock),
      description: "Primary",
      prefixListId: example.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cidr` - (Required) CIDR block of this entry.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of this entry. Due to API limitations, updating only the description of an entry requires recreating the entry.
* `prefixListId` - (Required) CIDR block of this entry.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the managed prefix list entry.

## Import

Prefix List Entries can be imported using the `prefixListId` and `cidr` separated by a `,`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list_entry.default pl-0570a1d2d725c16be,10.0.3.0/24
```
